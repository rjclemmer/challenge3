# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This week's challenge required modifying starter code to create an applcation that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that they've selected. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code

## Usage

When the button is clicked, alerts pop up asking users which characters they want to include in their password. After users select criteria, a random password is generated in the text area of the webpage.
